# isic-2024-challenge Kaggle

This repository contains the code for the isic-2024-challenge Kaggle competition.

## Overview

The isic-2024-challenge is a machine learning competition hosted on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to develop a model that can accurately classify skin lesion images into different categories.

## Dataset

The dataset for this competition consists of a large number of skin lesion images, along with their corresponding labels. The images are provided in a structured format, making it easy to load and preprocess them for training.

## Code Structure

The code in this repository is organized into several modules, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a brief overview of the code structure:

- `data_preprocessing.py`: This module contains functions for loading and preprocessing the dataset. It includes functions for data augmentation, resizing, and normalization.

- `model.py`: This module defines the architecture of the machine learning model used for classification. It includes functions for building the model, as well as training and evaluation.

- `utils.py`: This module contains utility functions that are used throughout the codebase. It includes functions for calculating evaluation metrics, saving and loading models, and visualizing results.

## Getting Started

To get started with this codebase, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the `data_preprocessing.py` script to preprocess the dataset.
4. Run the `model.py` script to train and evaluate the model.
5. Use the `utils.py` script for any additional utility functions or visualizations.

## Results

The results of the isic-2024-challenge Kaggle competition will be updated in this section once the competition is complete. Stay tuned for the final leaderboard rankings and evaluation metrics.
